This is a test JS project that I've created.

# Installation
After cloning the project, navigate to the root of the repository. Install the dependencies for the frontend and the backend.
```
cd Backend
npm install
```
```
cd ../front-end
npm install
```

Then run `nodemon` in both directories (in separate terminals) to start the backend and then the frontend.
